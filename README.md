##Testing

We are using skajdo-test-suite in our application. To install and run use:

```
> composer update skajdo/test-suite & php tests/run-tests.php run -s ./tests
```

## Usage example

We have a car and it will automatically notify all subsystems that it started.
Electronics will turn our headlights on.

```php

<?php

use \Skajdo\EventManager\EventManager;
use \Skajdo\EventManager\Event\EventInterface;
use \Skajdo\EventManager\Listener\ListenerInterface;

class Car {

    /**
     * @var bool
     */
    public $headlights = false;

    /**
     * @var EventManager
     */
    public $em;

    /**
     * Create new car
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->em = new EventManager();
        $this->em->addListener(new CarElectronics());
    }

    /**
     * Start the car
     */
    public function start()
    {
        $this->em->triggerEvent(new CarStartEvent($this));
    }
}

class CarStartEvent implements EventInterface
{
    /**
     * @var Car
     */
    protected $car;

    /**
     * @param Car $car
     */
    public function __construct(Car $car)
    {
        $this->car = $car;
    }

    /**
     * @return Car
     */
    public function getCar()
    {
        return $this->car;
    }
}

class CarElectronics implements ListenerInterface
{
    /**
     * Turn the headlights on when the car starts
     *
     * @priority 200
     * @param CarStartEvent $event
     */
    public function onCarStart(CarStartEvent $event)
    {
        $event->getCar()->headlights = true;
    }
}


$car = new Car();
$car->start();
echo ($car->headlights == true) ? 'HEADLIGHTS ARE ON' : 'HEADLIGHTS ARE OFF'; // returns HEADLIGHTS ARE ON


```
